This update is moderate in nature and incorporates relevant case law issued between March\\n3, 2023 and March 1, 2024. The title of the manual is abbreviated as “TBMP.” A citation to a section of the manual may be written as\\n“TBMP § _____ (2024).”\\nAs with previous editions, this edition is available online at the TTAB home page of the USPTO web site in\\na searchable, printable format as well as in PDF. Archived editions of the TBMP are also available at the TTAB\\'s\\nhome page. Several TTAB judges, attorneys, paralegals, and professional staff members contributed to this year’s annual\\nupdate. Their efforts in ensuring an accurate and timely update are very appreciated. Cheryl Butler\\n Senior Counsel and TBMP Editor\\n Trademark Trial and Appeal Board\\nJune   2024\\nINTRODUCTION\\n  INTRODUCTION\\nThe primary purpose of this manual is to pro vide stakeholders with basic information generally useful for\\nlitigating inter partes (trial) cases before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board. The manual does not modify,\\namend, or serve as a substitute for any existing statutes, rules, or decisional law and is not binding upon the\\nBoard, its re viewing tribunals, the Director, or the USPT O. Cf.,  In re Wine Society of America Inc., 12\\nUSPQ2d 1139 (TTAB 1989). Rather, the manual describes current practice and procedure under the applicable\\nauthority and incorporates amendments to the Trademark Act, Trademark Rules of Practice, Federal Rules,\\nand updates in case la w, where applicable, as of March 1, 2024. This manual contains links to a\\nUSPTO-created compilation of the Trademark Act and Trademark Rules of Practice that is made available\\nfor the public’s convenience and is not meant to serve as an official legal source. Those using rhe compilation\\nfor legal research should verify their results against the most current official editions of the Code of Federal\\nRegulations and United States Code, published Public Laws, and the daily Federal Register, as applicable. The guidelines set forth in the manual do not ha ve the force and ef fect of law. They have been developed\\nas a matter of internal office management and are not intended to create any right or benefit, substantive or\\nprocedural, enforceable by any party against the Office. The manual is devoted primarily to opposition and cancellation proceedings, the tw o most common types\\nof trial proceedings before the Board. Nonetheless, the manual includes a chapter of general information\\nuseful for all proceedings and chapters on interference proceedings, concurrent use proceedings, e x parte\\nappeals of applications to the Board, and e x parte appeals of e x parte e xpungement and ree xamination\\nproceedings to the Board. Updates this year are moderate, largely incorporating relevant case law reflected\\nin TTAB precedential decisions and related court decisions. The manual is updated periodically.

[Note 2.] There is no provision in the Trademark Rules of Practice concerning the applicability of the Federal Rules\\nof Evidence to ex parte appeals before the Board. However, certain of the principles embodied in the Federal\\nRules of Evidence are applied by the Board, in practice, in e valuating the probati ve value of e vidence\\nsubmitted in ex parte cases.

These decisions\\ninclude those of the Board , as well as the decisions of the United States Supreme Court; the Court of Appeals\\nfor the Federal Circuit (“Federal Circuit”) (which determines appeals from decisions of the Board); the\\nCourt of Customs and Patent Appeals (predecessor of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit), and the\\nDirector of The United States P atent and Trademark Office (formerly the Commissioner of P atents and\\nTrademarks) (“Director”), who determines petitions seeking review of Board actions on procedural matters. 100-4June   2024\\nTRADEMARK TRIAL AND APPEAL BOARD MANUAL OF PROCEDURE§ 101.03\\nThe Board relies primarily on precedent from the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The Federal\\nCircuit is the Board’ s primary re viewing court since by statute, an y applicant or party to an inter partes\\nproceeding who is dissatisfied with the Board’ s decision may seek re view of the decision in the Federal\\nCircuit. Also, the Federal Circuit\\'s cases address registration issues more specifically. [Note 1.] Decisions of the Board, the Director, and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, appear in the Bloomberg\\nLaw database as the United States Patent Quarterly (\"USPQ\"), [Note 2], and may also be found in LexisNexis\\nCorporation’s LEXIS le gal database, and in the Intellectual Property Library of Thomson Reuters\\nCorporation’s WESTLAW database. Recent, and a certain number of, final Board decisions are a vailable\\non a public electronic database by accessing the TTAB Reading Room at\\nhttps://ttab-reading-room.uspto.gov/efoia/efoia-ui/#/search/decisions through the Board home page of\\nthe USPTO website. [Note 3.] Docket information and full images of Board files, including decisions, may\\nbe viewed by accessing TTABVUE at http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/. [Note 4.] Decisions that are designated by the Board as “Citable as Precedent,” “Precedent of the Board,” “Precedent\\nof the TTAB,” or “for publication in full” are citable as precedent. Since January 23, 2007, the Board has\\npermitted citation to any Board decision or interlocutory order, although a decision or order designated as\\nnot precedential is not binding upon the Board, b ut may be cited for whate ver persuasive value it might\\nhave. [Note 5.] In general, however, the Board discourages the citation to non-precedential opinions. [Note\\n6.] Decisions of other tribunals may be cited to the extent allowed and for the purposes permitted by the tribunal\\nthat issued the decision. NOTES:\\n1. Grand Canyon West Ranch LLC v. Hualapai Tribe, 88 USPQ2d 1501, 1506 n.2 (TTAB 2008). See also\\n15 U.S.C. § 1071(a); 28 U.S.C. § 1295(a)(4)(B). 2. Bloomberg Law ceased publishing the USPQ in print form in December 2018. 3. The earliest Board decisions available in the TTAB Reading Room (“Reading Room”) are those issued\\nsince October 1996. There is a short delay before recently issued decisions appear in the Reading Room,\\ngenerally less than two weeks. Basic search functions are available in the Reading Room, e.g., proceeding\\nor application number, date range, citable as precedent of the TTAB, and common grounds for refusal or\\nasserted in trial cases. 4. Decisions and docket entries in Board cases are most easily accessed in TTABVUE by proceeding number,\\nfor trial cases; application number , for appeals of a final refusal to re gister an application; or re gistration\\nnumber, for appeals of an ex parte expungement or reexamination proceeding. TTABVUE has limited search\\nfunction. Precedents of the Board that issued in 2008 or later are a vailable in TTABVUE. Precedents of the Board\\nissued from 2000 to 2008 are generally , but not completely , available in TTABVUE. Precedents of the\\nBoard that issued before 2000 are not available in TTABVUE. 5.

It is written as a\\nguide for the Board, practitioners and parties before the Board. In addition to compiling applicable authority,\\nthe TBMP includes many practical suggestions on practice before the Board. Nonetheless, the TBMP “does\\nnot modify, amend, or serve as a substitute for any statutes, rules or decisional law and is not binding upon\\nthe [TTAB].” [Note 1.] The TBMP is re vised annually to incorporate changes in applicable statutes, rules, and case la w, and to\\nreflect changes in Board practice. [Note 2.] Practitioners and parties before the Board who consult the TBMP\\nshould keep the publication date of the current re vision in mind, and conduct an y research necessary to\\ndetermine whether there have been any relevant changes in the law since publication. The TBMP is not – nor is it intended to be – a comprehensive reference on all aspects of the procedural or\\nsubstantive law applicable to Board proceedings. Parties are urged to conduct appropriate legal research, as\\nneeded, or obtain legal counsel. SeeTBMP § 114. NOTES:\\n1. Rosenruist-Gestao E Servicos LD A v.

The Board is empowered to determine only the right to register. [Note 1.] The Board’s determination\\nof registrability does not require in e very instance a decision on e very pleaded claim, and the Board uses\\nits discretion to decide only those claims necessary to enter judgment and dispose of the case. [Note 2.] The Board is not authorized to determine the right to use, nor may it decide broader questions of infringement\\nor unfair competition. [Note 3.] The Board, being an administrative tribunal, has no authority to declare any portion of the Act of 1946, or\\nany other act of Congress, unconstitutional. [Note 4.] But this does not mean that parties who want to raise\\nchallenges to an act of Congress or other Constitutional claims should not include them in their pleadings. Like other claims, Constitutional claims should be raised before the Board to consider in the first instance\\nto avoid waiving them.

An opposition is a proceeding in which the plaintiff seeks to prevent the issuance of a registration, in whole\\nor in part, of a mark on the Principal Register. “Any person who believes that he would be damaged by the\\nregistration of a mark” may file an opposition thereto, b ut the opposition may be filed only as a timely\\nresponse to the publication of the mark, in the Official Gazette of the United States P atent and Trademark\\nOffice. [Note 1.] SeeTBMP § 303 (Who May Oppose or Petition to Cancel). A cancellation proceeding is a proceeding in which the plaintiff seeks to cancel an existing registration, in\\nwhole or in part, of a trademark on the Principal Re gister or the Supplemental Re gister. A petition for\\ncancellation may only be filed after the issuance of the registration. A petition for cancellation may be filed\\nby “any person who belie ves that he is or will be damaged by the re gistration” of the mark. [Note 2.] SeeTBMP § 303 (Who May Oppose or Petition to Cancel). An interference is a proceeding in which the Board determines which, if an y, of the owners of conflicting\\napplications (or of one or more applications and one or more registrations which are in conflict), is entitled\\nto registration. [Note 3.] The proceeding is declared by the Office only upon Petition to the Director showing\\nextraordinary circumstances therefor, that is, that the party who filed the petition would be unduly prejudiced\\nwithout an interference. [Note 4.] See TBMP § 1002 (Declaration of Interference). Ordinarily, the availability\\nof an opposition or cancellation proceeding is deemed to prevent any undue prejudice from the unavailability\\nof an interference proceeding. [Note 5.] An interference that has been declared by the Director is not instituted\\nby the Board until after all of the marks that are to be involved in the proceeding have been published in the\\nOfficial Gazette for opposition. SeeTBMP § 1003 . F or further information, see TBMP Chapter 1000\\n(Interferences). A concurrent use proceeding is a proceeding in which the Board determines whether one or more applicants\\nis entitled to a concurrent re gistration on the Principal Re gister, that is, a re gistration with conditions and\\nlimitations, fixed by the Board, as to the mode or place of use of the applicant’ s mark or the goods and/or\\nservices on or in connection with which the mark is used (usually, a concurrent registration is restricted as\\nto the territory which it co vers). SeeTBMP § 1101.01. The proceeding may be initiated only through the\\n100-10June   2024\\nTRADEMARK TRIAL AND APPEAL BOARD MANUAL OF PROCEDURE§ 102.02\\nfiling of an application for registration as a lawful concurrent user, and is instituted by the Board only after\\neach of the one or more involved applications has been published for opposition in the Official Gazette, and\\nall oppositions thereto (if any) have been withdrawn or dismissed. SeeTBMP § 1102.01 and TBMP § 1105. For further information, see TBMP Chapter 1100 (Concurrent Use Proceedings). The Board also has jurisdiction over ex parte appeals. Those are, appeals from an examining attorney’s final\\nrefusal to re gister a mark in an application and appeals after issuance of a final Office action in an\\nexpungement or ree xamination proceeding. [Note 6.] See TBMP Chapter 1200  (Ex P arte Appeals from\\nRefusals of Applications) and TBMP Chapter 1300 (Ex Parte Appeals from Expungement and Reexamination\\nof Registration Proceedings).

There are\\npleadings (at least in an opposition or cancellation proceeding); a wide range of possible motions;\\nconferencing; disclosures; discovery; trial; briefs; and, if requested, an oral hearing, followed by a decision\\non the case. [Note 1.] Ho wever, because the Board is an administrati ve tribunal, its rules and procedures\\nnecessarily differ in some respects from those prevailing in the federal district courts. [Note 2.] See also TBMP\\n§ 502.01 (Available Motions) and TBMP § 702 (Pretrial Disclosures; Manner of Trial; and Introduction of\\nEvidence). The principal difference is that proceedings before the Board are conducted in writing, and the\\nBoard’s actions in a particular case are based upon the written record therein. For example, the Board does\\nnot preside at the taking of testimony. Rather, all testimony is taken out of the presence of the Board during\\nthe assigned testimony periods, and the written transcripts thereof, together with an y exhibits thereto, are\\nthen filed with the Board. Indeed, a party to a proceeding before the Board need ne ver come to the offices\\nof the Board at all, unless the Board requests that the parties meet with the Board at its offices for a pretrial\\nconference pursuant to 37 C.F.R. § 2.120(j), or unless the party wishes to argue its case at oral hearing (an\\noral hearing is held only if requested by a party to the proceeding). P arties may stipulate to expediting the\\nproceeding in whole or in part utilizing Accelerated Case Resolution (ACR). SeeTBMP § 528.0 5 (a)(2) ,\\nTBMP § 702.04, and TBMP § 705. An ex parte appeal, being appellate in nature, is a much simpler and shorter procedure, in volving only the\\nfiling of briefs by the applicant or re gistrant and an examining attorney, and, if requested by the applicant\\nJune   2024100-11\\n§ 102.03GENERAL INFORMATION\\nor registrant, an oral hearing. SeeTBMP Chapter 1200 (Ex Parte Appeals from Refusals of Applications)\\nand TBMP Chapter 1300 (Ex P arte Appeals from Expungement and Ree xamination of Re gistration\\nProceedings). “The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board shall include the Director , Deputy Director of the United States\\nPatent and Trademark Office, the Commissioner for Patents, the Commissioner for Trademarks, and [the]\\nadministrative trademark judges....” [Note 3.] This Manual refers to these statutory members of the Board\\ncollectively as “judges.”\\nInterlocutory motions, requests, conceded matters, and other matters not actually or potentially dispositive\\nof a proceeding may be acted upon by a single Board judge, or by a single interlocutory attorney (“attorney”)\\nor paralegal to whom such authority has been delegated, and certain conceded and non-dispositive matters\\nmay be acted on automatically by ESTTA. [Note 4.] Decisions on the merits of a case, and on comple x or\\ncontested motions that are potentially dispositive of the case, are rendered by a panel of at least three Board\\njudges. [Note 5.] Stipulations or consented (or uncontested) motions to dispose of the proceeding in a certain\\nmanner may be decided per curiam by the Board. [Note 6.] Institution orders, stipulated scheduling motions,\\nissuance of notices of default, and other administrative matters may be acted upon by Board parale gals or\\nmay be administered through ESTTA. Motions disposed of by orders entitled ‘‘By the Trademark Trial and\\nAppeal Board’’ have the same legal effect as orders by a panel of three Administrative Trademark Judges\\nof the Board. [Note 7.] The parties must enter their changes of address and representation using ESTT A. For further information regarding ESTTA, see TBMP § 110. NOTES:\\n1. See B&B Hardware, Inc. v.

(a)   Signature required. Each piece of correspondence that requires a signature, must bear:\\n(1)   A handwritten signature personally signed in permanent ink by the person named as the signatory,\\nor a true copy thereof; or\\n(2)   An electronic signature that meets the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, personally\\nentered by the person named as the signatory.

(b)   Copy of original signature. If a copy of an original signature is filed, the filer should retain the\\noriginal as evidence of authenticity. If a question of authenticity arises, the Office may require submission\\nof the original. (c)   Requirements for electronic signature. A person signing a document electronically must:\\n(1)   Personally enter any combination of letters, numbers, spaces and/or punctuation marks that the\\nsigner has adopted as a signature, placed between two forward slash (“/”) symbols in the signature block\\non the electronic submission; or\\n(2)   Sign the verified statement using some other form of electronic signature specified by the Director. (d)   Signatory must be identified.

Responses to Office actions, amendments to\\napplications, requests for express abandonment, requests for reconsideration of final actions, and requests\\nto divide must be signed by the owner of the application or registration, someone with legal authority to\\nbind the owner (e.g. a corporate officer or general partner of a partnership), or a practitioner qualified to\\npractice under § 11.14 of this chapter, in accordance with the following guidelines:\\n100-16June   2024\\nTRADEMARK TRIAL AND APPEAL BOARD MANUAL OF PROCEDURE§ 106.02\\n(ii)   If the owner is not represented by a practitioner qualified to practice under § 11.14 of this\\nchapter, the individual owner or someone with legal authority to bind the owner (e.g., a corporate officer\\nor general partner of a partnership) must sign. In the case of joint owners who are not represented by a\\nqualified practitioner, all must sign. * * * *\\n(6)   Requests for correction, amendment or surrender of registrations. A request for correction,\\namendment or surrender of a registration must be signed by the owner of the registration, someone with\\nlegal authority to bind the owner (e.g., a corporate officer or general partner of a partnership), or a\\npractitioner qualified to practice before the Office under § 11.14 of this chapter. In the case of joint owners\\nwho are not represented by a qualified practitioner, all must sign. * * * *\\n(f)   Signature as certification. The presentation to the Office (whether by signing, filing, submitting, or\\nlater advocating) of any document by any person, whether a practitioner or non-practitioner, constitutes a\\ncertification under § 11.18(b) of this chapter. Violations of § 11.18(b) of this chapter may jeopardize the\\nvalidity of the application or registration, and may result in the imposition of sanctions under § 11.18(c) of\\nthis chapter. Any practitioner violating § 11.18(b) may also be subject to disciplinary action. See § 11.18(d)\\nand § 11.804 of this chapter. * * * *\\n(i)   Certified documents required by statute. When a statute requires that a document be certified, a\\ncopy or facsimile transmission of the certification is not acceptable. Every document filed in an inter partes or e x parte proceeding before the Board, and e very request for an\\nextension of time to file an opposition, must be signed by the party filing it, or by the party’ s attorney or\\nother authorized representative, as appropriate, and the signatory must be identified. [Note 1.] Documents filed electronically, including through ESTTA, do not require a conventional signature. Electronic\\nsignatures pursuant to 37 C.F.R. § 2.193(c) are required for electronic filings. The party or its representative\\nenters a “symbol” that has been adopted as a signature. The Board will accept any combination of letters,\\nnumbers, space and/or punctuation marks as a valid signature if it is placed between two forward slash (“/”)\\nsymbols. [Note 2.] The electronic signature entered on the ESTTA form is sufficient as the required signature\\nfor the entire submission, including in the absence of a signature on any attachment to the filing form. [Note\\n3.] The electronic filing cover sheet in ESTTA must be signed by the party filing it, the party’s attorney or\\nother authorized representative, as appropriate. For further information regarding the filing of submissions\\nusing ESTTA, see TBMP § 110. A party may act in its own behalf in a proceeding before the Board, if the party is domiciled in the United\\nStates, or an attorney may represent the party. [Note 4.] See TBMP § 114 (Representation of a Party). When an individual who is a party to a Board proceeding elects to act in the indi vidual\\'s own behalf, the\\nindividual must sign any documents that are filed with the Board. If a party which is a partnership elects to\\nact in its own behalf, a partner should sign documents filed by the partnership. If a party which is a corporation\\nor association elects to act in its own behalf, an officer thereof who is authorized to sign for the corporation\\nor association should sign for that corporation or association. If joint applicants elect to act on their o wn\\nbehalf, all joint applicants must sign any documents filed with the Board. [Note 5.] If a document is filed on behalf of a party by the party’s attorney or other authorized representative, it must\\nbear the signature of, and be personally signed or inserted by , that attorney or other representative, unless\\nJune   2024100-17\\n§ 106.02GENERAL INFORMATION\\nit is a document required to be signed personally by the party. An attorney or other authorized representative\\nwho signs a document, and then files it with the Board on behalf of a party , should remember that the\\nsignature to the document constitutes a certification of the elements specified in 37 C.F.R. § 11.18(b), and\\nthat a violation of the pro visions of that rule by may result in sanctions or disciplinary action. [Note 6.] SeeTBMP § 114.04 (regarding meaning of the designation “other authorized representati ve”) and TBMP\\n§ 527.02 (regarding motions for Fed. R. Civ. P. 11 sanctions). A person transmitting paper documents, when\\npermitted, for filing with the Board may sign a co ver letter or transmittal letter , and the Office does not\\nrequire the party, attorney, or authorized representative to sign a cover or transmittal letter. It is not appropriate for one person to sign a document for another person, as, for example, “John Smith, for\\nJohn Doe” or “John Doe, by John Smith.” [Note 7.] A document filed in a proceeding before the Board should include the first and last name, in typed or printed\\nform, of the person who signed [Note 8]; a description of the capacity in which the person signed (e.g., as\\nthe individual who is a party, if the filing party is an individual; as a corporate officer, if the filing party is\\na corporation; or as the filing party’s attorney); and the business address and telephone number of the person. The inclusion of the signing person’s address and phone number on the submission itself is vital in the rare\\ncase any paper or physical submissions permitted under the rules because mail physically sent to the Office\\nis opened in the Mail Room, and ordinarily the en velopes are discarded there before the mail is sent on to\\nits ultimate destination within the Office. Thus, the Board rarely sees the return addresses on the mailing\\nenvelopes of papers filed in Board proceedings. In accordance with 37 C.F.R. § 2.193(b), a legible copy of the signed document is to be filed with the Board\\nbecause filings are required to be submitted using ESTT A. The original should be retained as e vidence of\\nauthenticity. If a question as to the authenticity of a filed copy arises, the Office may require submission of\\nthe original. [Note 9.] Notwithstanding the requirement that a document filed before the Board be signed, an unsigned document\\nfiled in paper form, when permitted, will not be refused consideration if a signed cop y is submitted to the\\nBoard within the time limit set in the notification of this defect by the Board. [Note 10.] Similarly , an\\nimproperly signed document, whether filed in ESTT A or on paper , when permitted, will not be refused\\nconsideration if a properly signed cop y is submitted to the Board within the time set in the notification of\\nthis defect by the Board.

(a)   Submissions must be made to the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board via ESTTA. (1)   Text in an electronic submission must be filed in at least 11-point type and double-spaced. (2)   Exhibits pertaining to an electronic submission must be made electronically as an attachment\\nto the submission and must be clear and legible. (b)   In the event that ESTTA is unavailable due to technical problems, or when extraordinary\\ncircumstances are present, submissions may be filed in paper form. All submissions in paper form, except\\nthe extensions of time to file a notice of opposition, the notice of opposition, the petition to cancel, or answers\\nthereto (see §§ 2.101(b)(2), 2.102(a)(2), 2.106(b)(1), 2.111(c)(2), and 2.114(b)(1)), must include a written\\nexplanation of such technical problems or extraordinary circumstances. Paper submissions that do not meet\\nthe showing required under this paragraph (b) will not be considered. A paper submission, including exhibits\\nand depositions, must meet the following requirements:\\n(1)   A paper submission must be printed in at least 11-point type and double-spaced, with text on\\none side only of each sheet;\\n(2)   A paper submission must be 8 to 8.5 inches (20.3 to 21.6 cm.) wide and 11 to 11.69 inches (27.9\\nto 29.7 cm.) long, and contain no tabs or other such devices extending beyond the edges of the paper;\\n(3)   If a paper submission contains dividers, the dividers must not have any extruding tabs or other\\ndevices, and must be on the same size and weight paper as the submission;\\n(4)   A paper submission must not be stapled or bound;\\n(5)   All pages of a paper submission must be numbered and exhibits shall be identified in the manner\\nprescribed in § 2.123(g)(2);\\nJune   2024100-19\\n§ 106.03GENERAL INFORMATION\\n(6)   Exhibits pertaining to a paper submission must be filed on paper and comply with the requirements\\nfor a paper submission. (c)   To be handled as confidential, submissions to the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board that are\\nconfidential in whole or part pursuant to § 2.125(f) must be submitted using the “Confidential” selection\\navailable in ESTTA or, where appropriate, under a separate paper cover. Both the submission and its cover\\nmust be marked confidential and must identify the case number and the parties. A copy of the submission\\nfor public viewing with the confidential portions redacted must be submitted concurrently. The rules require that all submissions must be made to the Board electronically, currently through ESTTA,\\nsubject to certain limited e xceptions permitting submissions to be made on paper . Any permitted paper\\nsubmission must be accompanied by a written e xplanation showing that ESTTA was unavailable due to\\ntechnical problems, or that extraordinary circumstances are present, and, where required, a Petition to the\\nDirector with the requisite petition fee. [Note 1.] Ho wever, because ESTT A currently does not accept\\nmultimedia files, the Board will continue its current practice of accepting the submission of physical DVDs\\nor CDs as exhibits in inter partes proceedings for the limited purpose of allowing parties to submit multimedia\\nevidence, such as commercials. [Note 2.] The requirements for electronic submissions can be found in 37 C.F.R. § 2.126(a). Submissions over the\\nInternet are made through ESTT A which is a vailable on the USPT O website. [Note 3.] Using ESTT A, a\\nperson can complete and submit forms electronically, with attachments and/or exhibits, to the Board, making\\nan official filing online. ESTTA gives step-by-step instructions for properly completing a form. Available\\nforms and instructions can be found at: https://estta.uspto.gov. For more information re garding ESTTA,\\nsee TBMP § 110. The Board requires use of ESTTA for the filing of all submissions in Board proceedings. ESTT A permits\\nround-the-clock filing with real-time receipt confirmation, while reducing delay and the possibility of\\nmishandling of submissions within the USPTO. Many ESTTA filings are processed automatically, with an\\nappropriate Board order issuing within minutes of filing. ESTT A users are strongly ur ged to plan ahead. Because unexpected problems can occur , users should k eep filing deadlines in mind and allo w plenty of\\ntime to resolve any issue which may arise. The Board will provide general assistance to ESTTA filers but\\ncannot guarantee that any problem will be resolved prior to a deadline. If ESTTA filing is not possible prior\\nto a deadline for any reason, parties should timely submit their filings on paper using another accepted filing\\nmethod (e.g., certificate of mailing and Priority Mail Express® procedures). See TBMP § 111.02, et seq. (Certificates of Mailing), and TBMP § 111.01, et seq. (Priority Mail Express®). Any paper filing must be\\naccompanied by a written explanation showing that ESTTA was unavailable due to technical problems, or\\nthat extraordinary circumstances are present, and, where required, a Petition to the Director with the requisite\\npetition fee. Petitions to file on paper are subject to 37 C.F.R. § 2.146, including the requirement for verified\\nfacts. The requirement for use of ESTT A under all circumstances for the filing of either e xtensions of time to\\noppose or notices of opposition ag ainst Madrid Protocol applications, i.e., applications under Trademark\\nAct § 66(a), 15 U.S.C. § 1141f(a) , further enables the USPT O to fulfill its oblig ation to timely notify the\\nInternational Bureau of the World Intellectual Property Or ganization (“WIPO”) of oppositions ag ainst\\nrequests for extension of protection under the Madrid Protocol. A request for an extension of time to oppose\\na Madrid Protocol application which is not filed through ESTT A will be denied. Similarly , a notice of\\nopposition not filed through ESTTA against such an application will not be instituted. [Note 4.] Filers may call the Board with questions about filing at (571) 272-8500 or (800) 786-9199 (toll free). Alternatively, filers may send non-urgent email inquiries to ESTTA@uspto.gov, and include a description\\nof the problem, the ESTTA tracking number and Board proceeding number (if any), and a telephone number\\n100-20June   2024\\nTRADEMARK TRIAL AND APPEAL BOARD MANUAL OF PROCEDURE§ 106.03\\nfor contact. The Board will respond to email inquiries within tw o business days. The email address is for\\ntechnical ESTTA questions only. Documents will not be accepted for filing by email. The requirements for paper submissions, when permitted, are set out in 37 C.F.R. § 2.126(b) . A paper\\nsubmission must be 8 to 8.5 inches wide and 11 to 11.69 inches long, and printed in at least 11-point type\\nand double-spaced, with the text on one side only of each sheet. Business correspondence mar gins of one\\ninch are considered standard. If a paper submission contains dividers, the dividers may not contain tabs or\\nany devices that extend beyond the edges of the paper , and must be on the same size and weight paper as\\nthe submission. In addition, a paper submission must not be stapled or bound. This is important because all paper submissions\\nare scanned electronically into the Board’s electronic information system and removing staples or binding\\nprior to scanning is difficult and time-consuming, especially where papers ha ve been bound by machine. Moreover, disassembling stapled or bound papers can damage pages, resulting in jammed scanning equipment\\nand increasing the possibility that pages will become lost or disordered during scanning. [Note 5.] These\\nare additional reasons why the Board requires all submissions to be made using ESTTA. Any paper document filed with the Board must be either the original or a le gible copy thereof, on good\\nquality paper. [Note 6.] Extra copies of a document should not be submitted. [Note 7.] Exhibits pertaining to an electronic submission must be filed electronically through ESTTA as an attachment\\nto the submission and conform to the requirements for electronic submissions, e xcept when a party needs\\nto submit a multimedia exhibit on CD or DVD. [Note 8.] When making a submission of an exhibit on CD\\nor DVD, parties are advised to include in the accompanying ESTTA filing a ‘‘placeholder’’ exhibit page to\\nindicate the CD or DVD exhibit, and to mail the CD or DVD to the Board. See  TBMP § 110.02(c) regarding\\nsize limitations. Exhibits to a submission are also subject to the requirements of 37 C.F.R. § 2.126. A best\\npractice for electronic e xhibits in PDF form is to use a separator page for each e xhibit and to assign a\\nbookmark to that page with an alpha-numeric designation (such as A, B, C or 1, 2, 3) for easy na vigation\\nand location of the exhibit. Exhibits pertaining to a paper submission, where permitted, must be filed on paper and must comply with\\nthe requirements for a paper submission. [Note 9.] As with any paper submission, paper exhibits may not contain tabs, dividers or any such devices that extend\\nbeyond the edges of the paper, and moreover, may not be stapled or bound. However, it is acceptable to use\\nbinder clips or rubber bands, or similar de vices that w ould allow for easy separation of the papers for\\nscanning. Exhibits that are large, bulky, valuable, or breakable may be photographed or otherwise reproduced so that\\nan appropriate digitized or paper image of the e xhibits can be filed with the Board in lieu of the originals. Exhibits consisting of videotapes or audiotapes of commercials, demonstrations, etc., may not be filed\\nelectronically. The requirements for confidential submissions are specified in 37 C.F.R. § 2.126(c) . To be handled as\\nconfidential, and kept out of the public record, submissions to the Board that are confidential must be filed\\nunder a separate co ver. Both the submission and its co ver must be mark ed confidential and must identify\\nthe case number and the parties. A copy of the submission with the confidential portions redacted must also\\nbe submitted for the public record. [Note 10.] Confidential materials must be filed through ESTT A using\\nthe “CONFIDENTIAL” option. SeeTBMP § 120.02 and TBMP § 412.04 for information on filing confidential\\nmaterials. June   2024100-21\\n§ 106.03GENERAL INFORMATION\\nThe Board, in its discretion, may refuse to enter and consider submissions which are not in compliance with\\n37 C.F.R. § 2.126. Format of submissions. Apart from the identification, signature, and form requirements referred to above,\\nthere is no particular format that submissions to the Board must follo w. Nor does the Office ha ve printed\\nforms for any documents filed in Board proceedings. Where possible, parties are encouraged to include a\\ncitation to the TTABVUE docket entry and TTABVUE page number, e.g., 1 TTABVUE 2. [Note 11.] For\\nmaterial or testimony that has been designated confidential and which does not appear on TTABVUE, the\\nTTABVUE docket entry number where such material or testimon y is located should be included in an y\\ncitation. [Note 12.] Although there is no particular format that a submission must follow, in large record cases, the Board may\\ndirect the parties on the form of submission for e xhibits and may direct the parties to prepare and file an\\nappendix in a specific format.

The filing date of an electr onic submission is the date the\\nOffice receives the submission, based on Eastern Time, regardless of whether that date is a Saturday, Sunday,\\nor Federal holiday within the District of Columbia. ESTTA – the Electronic System for Trademark Trials and Appeals – is the Board’s current electronic filing\\nsystem. ESTTA is a web-based application available on the Internet. No special software (apart from a web\\nbrowser) need be installed on the user’ s computer in order to use ESTT A. Likewise, users need not open\\nan account or obtain a password, and there is no additional fee for use of ESTTA. The Board requires use of ESTTA for the filing of all submissions in Board proceedings and for filing of\\nextensions of time to oppose. ESTT A permits round-the-clock filing with real-time receipt confirmation,\\nwhile reducing delay and the possibility of mishandling of submissions in route to or within the USPT O. Many ESTTA filings are processed automatically, with an appropriate Board order issuing within minutes\\nof filing. Use of ESTTA helps filers avoid common (and sometimes fatal) pitfalls in filing, and allows the\\nBoard to efficiently and expeditiously process and act upon filings. Upon completion of a successful filing, a filer using ESTT A will recei ve both an on-screen and email\\nacknowledgement of receipt from ESTT A with the ESTT A tracking number and the filing information\\nincluding the official filing date. The filing date is the date on which the complete ESTTA filing (including\\nany required fee) is received in the USPTO. Although an ESTTA filing can be made from anywhere in the\\nworld, Eastern Time controls the filing date, not the local date from where the filing w as made. [Note 1.] ESTTA filers should not send hard copies of electronically-filed documents to the Board. 100-28June   2024\\nTRADEMARK TRIAL AND APPEAL BOARD MANUAL OF PROCEDURE§ 110.01\\nThe ESTTA user manual, ESTTA forms, and instructions for their use can be found at https://estta.uspto.gov/. Contextually appropriate help is a vailable throughout ESTT A by clicking on highlighted, h yper-linked\\nterms. These terms usually appear in blue, but may differ depending on your browser settings. Filers should\\nalso check “What’s New in ESTTA” for important user guidelines. It is the responsibility of the party making submissions to the Board using ESTT A to ensure that the\\nsubmissions have been entered into the trial record. P arties are urged to check not only the ESTT A filing\\nreceipts but also TTABVUE, the Board\\'s electronic docket information and file database, to ensure that all\\ndocuments have been properly transmitted and entered.

[Note 2.] The requirement for use of ESTT A\\nfor such filings enables the USPTO to fulfill its obligation to timely notify the International Bureau of the\\nWorld Intellectual Property Organization of oppositions against requests for extension of protection under\\nthe Madrid Protocol. A request for an extension of time to oppose a Madrid Protocol application which is\\nnot filed through ESTTA will be denied in all circumstances. [Note 3.] Similarly, a notice of opposition not\\nfiled through ESTTA against such an application will not be instituted under an y circumstances.

For instance, an ESTTA user filing a notice of opposition or petition for cancellation must\\nattach to its filing a pleading ( i.e., a short and plain statement sho wing that the filer is entitled to relief). Likewise, a party filing a motion for summary judgment must attach a motion, as well as an y affidavits or\\nother evidence in support of it. When such a file can or must be attached, ESTT A will prompt the user to\\nidentify the file on the user’s computer and attach it to the ESTTA submission. Once a file has been selected\\nand attached, the file may be opened in a separate window so that the user may determine whether all of the\\nrelevant pages of the selected file or files have been designated for filing. 110.02(b)  Form of ESTTA Attachments\\nAttachments to ESTTA filings may be in PDF format. [Note 1.] PDF files should be formatted in letter size\\n(8.5” x 11”), and should be rendered at 300 dpi resolution. ESTT A will accept either color or black and\\nwhite PDF documents for uploading. It is recommended that all documents submitted electronically via\\nESTTA be “machine readable” to allow the Board and others to search the document using key words, and\\nalso mark and copy text from it. Most word processors feature drop-down options to “create .pdf,” “save to\\n.pdf,” or “print to .pdf.”\\nThe filer is responsible for ensuring that all Board submissions – including attachments to ESTT A filings\\n– are le gible. Filers should be a ware that the quality of ESTT A submissions is often better than those\\nsubmitted in paper. [Note 2.] Problems with image quality sometimes arise when poor quality documents\\nare scanned or when the quality of legible documents is degraded in the scanning process; these problems\\ntypically arise in documents (or parts of documents) featuring graphical material, as opposed to text. Quality\\ncan sometimes be significantly de graded when contrast settings used in scanning are not appropriate for\\ngraphical material, or when color materials are scanned or copied in black and white prior to submission. If legibility of material in color or grayscale is important, filers are urged to scan the papers in color and to\\nadjust the scanner’s contrast settings to achie ve acceptable results prior to ESTT A filing. Users are ur ged\\nto check the quality of their submission in TTABVUE after filing. TTABVUE contains the same images\\nthat the Board will use in considering the submission; if the TTABVUE image is not of acceptable quality,\\nJune   2024100-31\\n§ 110.02(b)GENERAL INFORMATION\\nthe user should not assume that the Board will be able to vie w and consider it appropriately . [Note 3.] Original paper documents, when such submissions are permitted, are retained for a period of time, usually\\nless than one year, because, the Board works from the scanned images, rather than the originals. In addition, electronically submitted pleadings, motions, briefs, and the lik e must be formatted for at least\\n11-point type and be double-spaced. [Note 4.] Exhibits to pleadings, motions, and briefs need not be\\nreformatted to meet these requirements, but must be legible. NOTES:\\n1. PDF stands for Portable Document Format, a platform-independent, open standard for document exchange. TIFF and TXT files are no longer accepted. Most word processing programs can directly convert files into\\nPDF format. Alternatively, papers can usually be scanned in PDF format. 2. In re Loggerhead Tools, LLC, 119 USPQ2d 1429, 1433 n.5 (TT AB 2016) (filers are responsible for\\nensuring that all submissions are legible). All paper submissions, when permitted, are scanned by the Board\\nupon receipt. Please Note: whether filed in paper form or filed electronically, papers scanned into TTABVUE\\nappear the same way they look as when they are submitted. See, e.g., In re Sela Products., LLC, 107 USPQ2d\\n1580, 1584 n.5 (TTAB 2013) (examining attorney\\'s brief complied with the page limit in the word processing\\napplication but the pagination was changed such that the brief appeared o ver the limit when the brief w as\\nrendered into an image in TTABVUE). 3.

App’x 900 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (mem.). 4. 37 C.F.R. § 2.126(a). 110.02(c)  Size Limitations\\nESTTA is suited for large filings such as trial testimon y and notices of reliance. There is no specific limit\\nto the amount of e vidence one may submit in support of a Board proceeding. Ho wever, filers should use\\nreason and avoid the submission of irrelevant or merely cumulative evidence. The unnecessary submission\\nof large records is a significant burden upon the Board. [Note 1.] See TBMP § 702.05 for more information\\nabout submission of large records in general. Filers should, however, be aware of certain system limitations. Filers may attach one or more files to an y\\nESTTA form that permits or requires an attachment. The size limit for each file attached is 6 MB (per file),\\nand the aggre gate of all attached files for a single ESTT A transmission may not e xceed 53 MB (per\\nsubmission). However, because v ery lar ge files de grade the performance of the Board’ s electronic file\\nsystem,  filers should limit each ESTTA submission to no more than an aggregate (all attached files combined)\\n100-32June   2024\\nTRADEMARK TRIAL AND APPEAL BOARD MANUAL OF PROCEDURE§ 110.02(c)\\nso as not to exceed the limitations. If a single submission, e.g., a single testimonial transcript or notice of\\nreliance, will exceed the limitations, it should be broken into two or more submissions, in logical segments,\\nfiled consecutively.

Mattel Inc. , 100 USPQ2d 1868,\\n1873 (TTAB 2011) (parties submitted much more e vidence than w as necessary to support respecti ve\\npositions). 110.03  Service of ESTTA Filings\\nExcept for the notice of opposition, the petition to cancel, or notice of a concurrent use proceeding, e very\\nsubmission filed in a Board inter partes proceeding must be served upon the other parties to the proceeding,\\nand proof of service must be provided before the paper will be considered. [Note 1.] For all other submissions\\nfiled in ESTTA, the filer must include a certificate of service as an attachment (or as part of an attachment)\\nto the ESTTA filing as proof of service. However, many of the ESTTA forms, e.g., “consent motion forms,”\\ninclude a certificate of service as part of the ESTTA submission. In that instance only, the filer need not add\\na certificate of service to the attached document. In addition to the requirement for a certificate of service, all submissions must actually be served upon the\\nother parties to the proceeding by email, unless otherwise stipulated. [Note 2.] SeeTBMP § 113 (Service\\nof Papers). The Board effects service only of the notice of opposition or petition to cancel or notice of concurrent use\\nproceeding by pro viding, in the notice of institution, a web link or web address to access the electronic\\nproceeding record. [Note 3.] For all other filings, ESTTA does not automatically serve papers upon opposing\\nparties. [Note 4.] For a further discussion re garding the filing of a notice of opposition or a petition for cancellation using\\nESTTA, and notification, see TBMP § 306.01 (notice of opposition); and TBMP § 307.01-TBMP § 307.02\\n(petition for cancellation).

Scott, 88 USPQ2d 1862, 1863\\nn.3 (TTAB 2008) (same). 110.04  Questions About ESTTA Filing\\nFilers may call the Board with questions about filing at (571) 272-8500 or (800) 786-9199 (toll free) from\\n8:30 a.m. until 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time). Alternatively, filers may send non-ur gent email inquiries to\\nESTTA@uspto.gov, and include a description of the problem, the ESTT A tracking number and Board\\nproceeding number (if any), and a telephone number for contact. The Board will respond to email inquiries\\nwithin two business days. The email address is for technical ESTTA questions only. Submissions will not\\nbe accepted for filing by email. SeeTBMP § 107 (“The Board does not accept any filings by email.”). ESTTA users are encouraged to contact the Board when ESTT A is not w orking as expected. Whether or\\nnot one is able to overcome a problem, others are likely to have similar difficulties. Absent notification by\\nusers, the Board may be unaware of the problem, delaying any necessary repair. 111  Priority Mail Express® and Certificate of Mailing Procedures\\nThe procedures described below apply to submissions in paper form. The Priority Mail Express® procedure discussed belo w at TBMP § 111.01 and the certificate of mailing\\nprocedure discussed below at TBMP § 111.02 apply only to paper submissions that meet an e xception to\\nthe requirement that submissions be filed electronically using ESTT A. F or information re garding the\\nelectronic filing of submissions through ESTTA, see TBMP § 110. 111.01  Priority Mail Express® - In General\\n37 C.F.R. § 2.198 Filing of correspondence by Priority Mail Express®. (a)   The filing date of correspondence submitted under this section is the date of deposit with the USPS,\\nas shown by the \"date accepted\" on the Priority Mail Express® label or other official USPS notation. (b)   If the USPS deposit date cannot be determined, the filing date is the date the Office receives the\\nsubmission. (c)   If there is a discrepancy between the filing date accorded by the Office to the correspondence and\\nthe “date accepted,” the party who submitted the correspondence may file a petition to the Director under\\n§ 2.146(a)(2) to accord the correspondence a filing date as of the “date accepted.” The petition must:\\n(1)   Be filed within two months after the date of deposit;\\n(2)   Include a true copy of the Priority Mail Express® mailing label showing the “date accepted,”\\nand any other official notation by the USPS relied upon to show the date of deposit; and\\n(3)   Include a verified statement attesting to the facts of the original mailing.

Otherwise, it should appear in its entirety on the last page of the\\ncorrespondence to which it pertains. If the certificate is typed, and there is not enough room on the last page\\nto type the certificate in its entirety , it should at least be started on the last page, so that only part of it\\nJune   2024100-39\\n§ 111.02(c)GENERAL INFORMATION\\ncontinues over to another page. The simple certificate of mailing format should ne ver be used by itself on\\na separate page at the end of the correspondence. If it is, and the page becomes detached from the rest of\\nthe submission, there will be no way of determining the identity of the correspondence to which it relates,\\nand the benefit of the certificate will be lost. In some cases, there may not be room for a certificate of mailing on a piece of correspondence. In such a\\ncase, the certificate may be typed on a separate sheet of paper securely attached to the correspondence. However, if the certificate is typed on a separate sheet of paper , it must include additional information,\\nnamely, a description of the nature of the correspondence to which it pertains, as well as the identity of the\\napplication, registration, or Office proceeding in connection with which the correspondence is being filed. If there is an y doubt concerning the identity of the correspondence to which a certificate of mailing on a\\nseparate sheet pertains, the certificate will not be accepted. 111.02(d)  Loss of Certificate of Mailing\\nIf a certificate of mailing is typed on a separate sheet of paper attached to a piece of correspondence, and\\nthe certificate becomes detached, after the correspondence is filed in the Office, and does not contain\\nidentifying information sufficient to enable the Office to associate the certificate with the appropriate piece\\nof correspondence, the Office will accept, as e vidence that the certificate w as filed with the specified\\ncorrespondence, a postcard receipt ( seeTBMP § 108 ) which identifies the separate certificate of mailing\\nsheet and the correspondence to which it was attached; accompanied by a copy of the certificate of mailing\\nsheet as originally mailed. 111.02(e)  No Receipt of Correspondence Bearing Certificate\\nIn the event that correspondence intended for the USPT O is timely filed with an appropriate certificate of\\nmailing, pursuant to 37 C.F.R. § 2.197, but is not received in the Office, and there is a resulting Office action,\\nin a proceeding or an application, which is adv erse to the submitting party , the correspondence will be\\nconsidered timely if the party which submitted it (1) informs the Office of the pre vious mailing of the\\ncorrespondence promptly after becoming a ware that the Office has no e vidence of receipt of the\\ncorrespondence, (2) supplies an additional cop y of the pre viously mailed correspondence and certificate,\\nand (3) includes a statement attesting, on a personal knowledge basis or to the satisfaction of the Director,\\nto the pre vious timely mailing. The statement must be v erified if it is made by a person other than a\\npractitioner, as that term is defined in 37 C.F.R. § 11.1 . See alsoTBMP § 107  (How and Where to File\\nPapers and Fees). [Note 1.] Documents may not be filed with the Board by facsimile transmission, and any\\ndocument so filed will not be accepted. [Note 2.] For lost or misplaced correspondence intended for the Board, the evidence required by 37 C.F.R. § 2.197(b)\\nshould be submitted to the Board for consideration. If the requirements of 37 C.F.R. § 2.197(b) cannot be\\nmet, the only alternative is a Petition to the Director.

[Note 1.] The certificate of mailing procedure is applicable to all other types\\nof paper filings in Board proceedings, only to the limited e xtent paper filings are permitted (see TBMP §\\n106.03), including a notice of opposition; a petition to cancel; a request for an extension of time to oppose\\na Trademark Act § 1 or § 44 application, 15 U.S.C. § 1051(a)and 15 U.S.C. § 1126; a notice of appeal to\\nthe Board from a final refusal of re gistration of a mark in an application; a notice of appeal after issuance\\nof a final Office action in an expungement or reexamination proceeding; a notice of appeal to the Court of\\nAppeals for the Federal Circuit from a decision of the Board; and a notice of election (in an inter partes\\nproceeding) to proceed by civil action under Trademark Act § 21(a)(1), 15 U.S.C. § 1071(a)(1), in response\\nto another party’ s appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Any paper filing must be\\naccompanied by a written statement sho wing that ESTTA was unavailable due to technical problems, or\\nthat extraordinary circumstances are present, and, where required, a Petition to the Director with the requisite\\npetition fee. Petitions to file on paper are generally subject to 37 C.F.R. § 2.146, including the requirement\\nfor verified facts. [Note 2.] However, a Petition to the Director to accept paper submission of a petition to\\ncancel a registration on the fifth year anni versary of the date of re gistration is subject to the requirements\\nof 37 C.F.R. § 2.20 or 28 U.S.C. § 1746. [Note 3.] A certificate of mailing is not necessary or appropriate for documents filed using ESTTA. When an ESTTA\\nfiling is received by the Board, the filer will be provided with a notice that the document has been successfully\\nfiled. See generallyTBMP § 110.09.

Correspondence sent to the\\nBoard by certified mail, and not in compliance with the 37 C.F.R. § 2.197(a) requirements for a certificate\\nof mailing, will be stamped with the date of receipt of the correspondence in the Office, and that date will\\nbe used for all purposes, including the timeliness of the filing of the correspondence. [Note 1.] Further, a certificate of mailing is not the equi valent of a certificate of service. A certificate of mailing\\nindicates when correspondence w as sent to the Office pursuant to the pro visions of 37 C.F.R. § 2.197(a). The mailing date recited in a certificate of mailing is used for purposes of determining the timeliness of the\\nfiling of the correspondence bearing the certificate.

Whenever periods of time ar e\\nspecified in this part in days, calendar days are intended. When the day, or the last day fixed by statute or\\nregulation by or under this part for taking any action or paying any fee in the Office falls on a Satur day,\\nSunday or Federal holiday within the District of Columbia, the action may be taken, or the fee paid, on the\\nnext succeeding day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or a Federal holiday. For example, if, as set by the Board, an answer to a complaint f alls due on a Saturday, Sunday, or federal\\nholiday within the District of Columbia, an answer filed on the next business day will be considered timely. If, as set by the Board, the close of disco very falls on a Saturday , Sunday, or federal holiday within the\\nDistrict of Columbia, and such date is the due date for written responses to disco very requests (i.e.,\\ninterrogatories, requests for production of documents, and requests for admission), such responses may be\\nserved, and discovery depositions may be taken, on the next business day. Similarly, if, as set by the Board,\\nthe close of a testimony period falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or federal holiday within the District of Columbia,\\ntestimony depositions may be taken, testimony declarations and affidavits may be filed, and other evidence\\nmay be offered, on the next business day. [Note 1.] If, because of some unscheduled event, such as adverse weather conditions, the Office is officially closed\\nby Executive Order of the President or by the Office of Personnel Management for an entire day , that day\\nwill be regarded by the Office as a federal holiday within the District of Columbia. Any action due to be\\ntaken, or fee due to be paid, on that day, will be considered timely if the action is taken, or the fee paid, on\\nthe next succeeding b usiness day on which the Office is open. If, because of an unscheduled e vent, the\\nOffice is closed for part of a b usiness day, but is open for business for some part of the day between 8:30\\na.m. and 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time, any action due to be taken, or fee due to be paid, on that day remains due\\non that day. [Note 2.] Notification of an y change in this polic y, given the particular circumstances of an\\nunscheduled event, will be posted on the Office website at www.uspto.gov. [Note 3.] Except for maintenance\\nand emergencies, ESTTA remains available for electronic filing of papers at all times despite official closure\\nof the Office. Please Note:37 C.F.R. § 2.196 is not applicable when the opening of an assigned period (e.g., disco very,\\ntestimony) falls on a Saturday, Sunday or Federal holiday. In addition, 37 C.F.R. § 2.196 does not apply to a motion that must be filed before the day of the deadline\\nfor pretrial disclosures for the first testimony period. [Note 4.] The provisions of 37 C.F.R. § 2.196  do not change the date on which the rele vant action must be tak en. Instead, the provisions allow an action to be considered timely filed if taken on the next succeeding business\\nday notwithstanding the earlier e xpiration of the due date on the week end on or a federal holiday . Thus,\\nwhen the date for any subsequent action runs from a prior due date or close of a period (e.g., filing a brief\\n100-42June   2024\\nTRADEMARK TRIAL AND APPEAL BOARD MANUAL OF PROCEDURE§ 112\\nafter the close of the last testimon y period), the due date for the subsequent action is calculated from the\\nactual due date of the prior action or close of the period, not the adjusted date under 37 C.F.R. § 2.196.

Proof of such service must be made before the submission will be considered by the Office. A statement\\nsigned by the attorney or other authorized representative, attached to or appearing on the original paper\\nwhen filed, clearly stating the date and manner in which service was made will be accepted as prima facie\\nproof of service. (b)   Service of submissions filed with the Board and any other papers served on a party not required to\\nbe filed with the Board, must be on the attorney or other authorized representative of the party if there be\\nsuch or on the party if there is no attorney or other authorized representative, and must be made by email,\\nunless otherwise stipulated, or if the serving party can show by written explanation accompanying the\\nsubmission or paper, or in a subsequent amended certificate of service, that service by email was attempted\\nbut could not be made due to technical problems or extraordinary circumstances, then service may be made\\nin any of the following ways:\\n(1)   By delivering a copy of the submission to the person served;\\nJune   2024100-43\\n§ 113GENERAL INFORMATION\\n(2)   By leaving a copy at the usual place of business of the person served, with someone in the\\nperson’s employment;\\n(3)   When the person served has no usual place of business, by leaving a copy at the person’s\\nresidence, with some person of suitable age and discretion who resides there;\\n(4)   Transmission by the Priority Mail Express® Post Office to Addressee service of the United States\\nPostal Service or by first-class mail, which may also be certified or registered\\n(5)   Transmission by overnight courier; or\\n(6)   Other forms of electronic transmission. (c)   When service is made by first-class mail, Priority Mail Express®, or overnight courier, the date of\\nmailing or of delivery to the overnight courier will be considered the date of service. (d)   If a party to an inter partes proceeding is not domiciled in the United States and is not represented\\nby an attorney or other authorized representative located in the United States, none of the parties to the\\nproceeding is eligible to use the service option under paragraph (b)(4) of this section. The party not domiciled\\nin the United States may designate by submission filed in the Office the name and address of a person\\nresiding in the United States on whom may be served notices or process in the proceeding. If the party has\\nappointed a domestic representative, official communications of the Office will be addressed to the domestic\\nrepresentative unless the proceeding is being prosecuted by an attorney at law or other qualified person\\nduly authorized under § 11.14(c) of this chapter. If the party has not appointed a domestic representative\\nand the proceeding is not being prosecuted by an attorney at law or other qualified person, the Office will\\nsend correspondence directly to the party, unless the party designates in writing another address to which\\ncorrespondence is to be sent. The mere designation of a domestic representative does not authorize the\\nperson designated to prosecute the proceeding unless qualified under § 11.14(a) of this chapter, or qualified\\nunder § 11.14(b) of this chapter and authorized under § 2.17(f). (e)   Every submission filed in an inter partes proceeding, and every request for an extension of time to\\nfile an opposition, must be signed by the party filing it, or by the party’s attorney or other authorized\\nrepresentative, but an unsigned submission will not be refused consideration if a signed copy is submitted\\nto the Office within the time limit set in the notification of this defect by the Office. * * * *\\nParties are required to use email as the method of service for submissions filed with the Board and any other\\npapers not required to be filed with the Board, unless the parties stipulate to an alternative service method,\\nor unless technical problems or e xtraordinary circumstances prevent email service. [Note 1.] When email\\nservice is not practical, for example, due to the size of the attachment, the Board encourages parties to agree\\non an effective alternative method of service, such as file hosting services.

Reg. 69950, 69959 (October 7, 2016). 113.01  Requirement for Service of Submissions\\nExcept for the notice of opposition or the petition to cancel, e very submission filed in an inter partes\\nproceeding before the Board, including a notice of appeal from a decision of the Board, must be served by\\nthe filing party upon every other party to the proceeding. [Note 1.] 100-44June   2024\\nTRADEMARK TRIAL AND APPEAL BOARD MANUAL OF PROCEDURE§ 113.01\\nThe requirement for service also applies to submissions that must be filed with the Board because the Board\\nhas jurisdiction over the opposed application or the re gistration sought to be cancelled. SeeTBMP § 515\\nand TBMP § 602. [Note 2.] For example, a request to amend or correct an application or registration which\\nis the subject of an inter partes proceeding, an abandonment of that application, or a voluntary surrender of\\nthe involved registration, must be filed with the Board and served by the defendant upon every other party\\nto the proceeding. In addition, the requirement for service applies to documents filed with the Trademark Examining Operation\\nor the USPTO\\'s Assignment Center regarding an application or registration which is the subject of a Board\\nproceeding, if the documents could have an effect on the inter partes proceeding. For example, a change of\\ncorrespondence address for an applicant/assignee (see TMEP § 609.02(f)), a correction to a registrant/owner’s\\naddress, separate from its correspondence address (see TMEP § 1609.11), or the submission of an assignment\\nrecordation sheet (see TMEP § 503.02), all of which are filed with the Office using TEAS or Assignment\\nCenter, must also be served by the defendant upon every other party to the proceeding. NOTES:\\n1. 37 C.F.R. § 2.119(a). 2. 37 C.F.R. § 2.133; 37 C.F.R. § 2.135. 113.02  Requirement for Proof of Service\\nWhen a party to an inter partes proceeding before the Board files a submission required by 37 C.F.R. §\\n2.119(a) to be serv ed upon e very other party to the proceeding, proof that the required service has been\\nmade ordinarily must be submitted before the filing will be considered by the Board. Occasionally, in order\\nto expedite matters, and when the interests of the other party or parties would be served thereby, the Board\\nitself will serve, along with an action of the Board relating thereto, a cop y of a submission that does not\\ninclude the required proof of service. For example, if an applicant in an opposition files an abandonment of\\nits involved application without the written consent of the opposer, and the abandonment does not include\\nproof of service upon the opposer, the Board does not send out an action stating that the abandonment will\\nnot be considered until proof of service has been submitted. Rather , the Board provides an electronic link\\nto the TTABVUE database for the filed abandonment, along with a copy of an action by the Board entering\\njudgment in opposer’ s f avor pursuant to 37 C.F .R. § 2.135  (which pro vides, in part, that after the\\ncommencement of an opposition, if the applicant files a written abandonment of its application or mark\\nwithout the written consent of every adverse party to the proceeding, judgment shall be entered against the\\napplicant). [Note 1.] The notice of filing pro vided by ESTTA to each party when a submission is made does not substitute for\\nservice by the filing party. [Note 2.] NOTES:\\n1. See, e.g., Central Manufacturing Inc. v. Third Millennium Tech. Inc., 61 USPQ2d 1210, 1212 n.3 (TTAB\\n2001) (unserv ed cop y of objection to further e xtensions of time to oppose filed prior to institution of\\nproceeding forwarded to opposer). 2,  See Coffee Studio LLC v. Reign LLC, 129 USPQ2d 1480, 1482 (TTAB 2019) (filing notice sent to each\\nparty by ESTTA does not constitute service). June   2024100-45\\n§ 113.02GENERAL INFORMATION\\n113.03  Elements of Certificate of Service\\nThe Board will accept, as prima facie proof that a party filing a document in a Board inter partes proceeding\\nhas served a copy of the document upon every other party to the proceeding, a statement signed by the filing\\nparty, or by its attorne y or other authorized representati ve, clearly stating the date and manner in which\\nservice was made. The statement should also specify the name of each party or person upon whom service\\nwas made, and the address, including the email address. The statement must appear on, or be securely\\nattached to, the document being filed. If the statement is on a separate sheet attached to the filing, it should\\nclearly identify the submission and proceeding to which it relates. [Note 1.] NOTES:\\n1. See 37 C.F.R. § 2.119(a). Suggested Format\\nShown below is a suggested format for a certificate of service:\\n I hereby certify that a true and complete copy of the foregoing (insert title of submission) has been served\\non (insert name of opposing counsel or party) by forwarding said copy on (insert date of mailing), via email\\n(or insert other appropriate method of delivery) to: (set out name, address, and email address of opposing\\ncounsel or party). __________________\\n Signature\\n113.04  Manner of Service\\nService of submissions filed with the Board and an y paper served on a party not required to be filed with\\nthe Board, must be made by email, unless otherwise stipulated, or if the serving party can show by written\\nexplanation accompanying the submission or paper, or subsequent amended certificate of service, that service\\nby email was attempted but could not be made due to technical problems or e xtraordinary circumstances. [Note 1.] The best practice is to reduce such a stipulation to writing, although the agreement should not be\\nfiled with the Board unless necessary to resolve a motion. In the event service by email cannot be made, service of submissions filed in inter partes cases may be made\\nin any of the ways specified in 37 C.F.R. § 2.119(b). They are: (1) by hand delivering a copy of the submission\\nto the person being serv ed; (2) by lea ving a copy of the submission at the usual place of b usiness of the\\nperson being served, with someone in the person’s employment; (3) when the person being serv ed has no\\nusual place of business, by leaving a copy of the submission at the person’ s address, with some person of\\nsuitable age and discretion who resides there; (4) transmission by the “Priority Mail Express® Post Office\\nto Addressee” service of the United States Postal Service or by first-class mail, which may also be certified\\nor registered; (5) transmission by o vernight courier; and (6) other forms of electronic transmission. [Note\\n2.] When service is made by mail, pursuant to 37 C.F.R. § 2.119(b)(4), the Board considers the mailing date\\nof the submission to be the date when the paper is deposited with the United States Postal Service, i.e., the\\ndate when custody of the paper passes to the Postal Service. As provided in 37 C.F.R. § 2.119(a), the Board\\n100-46June   2024\\nTRADEMARK TRIAL AND APPEAL BOARD MANUAL OF PROCEDURE§ 113.03\\nordinarily accepts, as prima f acie proof of the date of mailing, the statement signed by the filing party , or\\nby its attorney or other authorized representative, as to the date and manner of service. However, where the\\nprima facie proof of the certificate of service is rebutted by other evidence, and the paper would be timely\\nserved if mailed on the date specified in the certificate of service, b ut untimely served if not mailed until\\nthe date indicated by the rebutting evidence, the Board may request that the person who signed the certificate\\nof service submit an affida vit specifying the date when the paper w as actually deposited with the United\\nStates Postal Service. Service may be made by other forms of electronic transmission, such as fax. [Note 3.] Incorrect manner of service issues by a party domiciled outside the United States is less lik ely to arise in\\nview of the requirement that foreign domiciled parties to Board proceedings be represented by an attorney\\nwho is an acti ve member in good standing of the bar of the highest court of a state in the United States\\n(including the District of Columbia or any Commonwealth or territory of the United States). [Note 4.] Unless\\na party is domiciled in the United States or its territories, a party cannot represent itself on its o wn behalf. See TBMP §114. A foreign-domiciled party that has appointed a reciprocally-recognized foreign attorne y\\nor agent, but has not yet appointed U.S. counsel to represent it before the Board, cannot serv e an adverse\\nparty by the manners of service specified in 37 C.F.R. § 2.119(b)(1) - 37 C.F.R. § 2.119(b)(3). Moreover,\\na foreign party may not substitute its national postal service, or omit reference to the nation of the postal\\nservice employed, as a means of using 37 C.F.R. § 2.119(b)(4) manner of service; 37 C.F.R. § 2.119(b)(4)\\nrequires transmission by the USPS. [Note 5.] As a practical matter, parties and U.S. counsel that are located outside the United States and are unable to\\nserve submissions by email must meet the service requirement through 37 C.F.R. § 2.119(b)(5) - 37 C.F.R. § 2.119(b)(6).

The time for taking\\naction is no longer enlarged by 5 days. Rather, all fifteen-day response dates to submissions serv ed by an\\nadverse party are now amended to twenty days. [Note 1.] In addition, Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(d) is not applicable\\nto Board proceedings. As an alternative to email service, parties may stipulate to accept service by other\\nmeans but also agree to serv e a courtesy copy by email. Please Note: a courtesy copy does not substitute\\nfor proper service under the applicable Trademark Rules. [Note 2.] For example, if one party to a proceeding serves, upon another party to the proceeding, a motion to compel\\ndiscovery by email or other means stipulated to by the parties, the served party’s time for filing a response\\nto the motion will be 20 days from the date of service of the motion. “The e xtra five days provided for in\\nformer § 2.119(c) are already built into the response time period.” [Note 3.] There is no extra response period\\nbuilt into the 30-day response period for responding to discovery or for responding to a motion for summary\\njudgment.
